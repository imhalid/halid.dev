Here is a solution I made for the Type Calculator challenge published by
Frontend Mentor. In difficulty, we are asked:
**"Warning when 0 or a smaller number is entered into the input"**

If you want to review the final version of the study and all the codes: [codePen](https://codepen.io/imhalid/pen/vYRyBMB).

<Img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40598819/180600059-0195037b-5734-4cdb-878b-5fc99a5770a3.png" />
The desired work from us is to be as in the picture. The title and warning message
should appear above the input as shown in the picture.

```html showLineNumbers title="html code" {1, 3}
<div class="numberOfPeople">
  <input type="number" />
  <div class="texts">
    <p>Number of People</p>
    <p class="alert">Can't be zero</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

If I had the `texts` group above the input in the html code,
I could not access the `alert` with the CSS selectors. so i reversed groups
in html code and used `flex-direction: column-reverse`
for `numbersOfPeople`. so that it will look as I want and I can access `alert`.

```css showLineNumbers title="css code" {3}
.numberOfPeople {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column-reverse;
}
```

#### How can we show the warning if the value entered in the input is outside the desired number?

We need to use the `min` and `value` property for inputs. And we need to use a CSS selector `:out-of-range`

```html showLineNumbers title="min and value"
<input type="number" id="people" placeholder="0" value="" min="1" />
```

- With `min` we determine the minimum value that can be entered for the input.
- We set the default value with `value`. this is an optional option.

```css showLineNumbers title="if input less 1 => alert opacity 1"
input[type="number"]:out-of-range + .texts > .alert {
  color: var(--alertRed);
  opacity: 1;
}
```

The css selector `:out-of-range` provides an arrangement to give us an error message if the
value entered in the input does not match `min`.
